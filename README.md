<h2>Description</h2>

This project is the third class of <i>Jornada Python</i> from <i>Hashtag Treinamentos</i> and it 
consists in a customer's bank score analysis. This score will define if the bank will offer a bank 
loan to customers or maybe another bank services. This project's goal is to make a database processing 
and then, to create classification algorithms which algorithm is the best for this case.

<h2>How to install and run the project</h2>

You need to clone the repository by doing the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/leoGeraldino/aula2_jornadaPython.git```

In ```VSCode```, you need to install the extension ```Jupyter``` from Microsoft (I recommend this extension).

After this step, you need to configure a virtual environment, like this: ```python -m venv <virtual_environment_name>```

And activate it: ```<virtual_environment_name>\Scripts\activate```

Finally, you need to install the ```requirements.txt``` file, like this: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and so you are ready to run the code, block by block, to see the AI models done.

<h2>How to use the project</h2>

This project was built just for didactic purposes, but you can modify it according to your needs. For example, you can training a model to predict the rain probability according some weather informations (humidity, atmospheric pressure and much more), with some weather databases <a target= "_blank" href= "https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> database. Feel comfortable to use it as you need.
